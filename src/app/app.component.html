<!-- [image]: a property binding, where the value inside the curly braces {} is passed to the image input of the app-dashboard-item component. It is an object with two properties: src and alt -->
<!-- title: a simple property binding (without square brackets), meaning it will be passed as a string value to the title input of the component. The string provided is "Server Status/Traffic/Support Tickets", 
 which would likely be displayed as a title or heading. -->
